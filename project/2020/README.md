# SWEN90007 Project - 2020 SM2

In this subject, we will discuss a variety of design principles and architectural patterns for enterprise applications. In this project, students will have the opportunity to gain practical experience in the implementation of these patterns by developing an examination platform to facilitate online subject delivery. 

The project aims to give students the experience to:
* Produce an architectural design for an enterprise system.
* Choose suitable design patterns to be applied for the different architectural layers.
* Implement an application for your design. 
* Develop employability skills: teamwork, good communication, collaboration, problem-solving, critical-thinking, adaptability, initiative and leadership.
